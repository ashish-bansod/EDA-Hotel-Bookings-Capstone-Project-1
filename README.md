# EDA-Hotel-Bookings-Capstone-Project
Exploratory data analysis on hotel bookings dataset.

# Summary
This project involves analyzing hotel booking data for City and Resort hotels using a structured workflow consisting of three categories: Data Collection and Understanding, Data Cleaning and Manipulation, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The dataset contains 119,390 rows and 32 columns, and important columns are identified and updated. Duplicate data items are removed, and missing values are handled using data wrangling methods. The EDA phase involves using charts and graphs to identify patterns and trends, such as peak season for bookings, average lead time, and cancellation rates. The insights gained from this analysis can help hotel management make informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and staffing. Overall, this project highlights the importance of utilizing data science techniques to obtain insights that can inform business decisions.

# Business Objective
Conduct an analysis of the booking data for both the City Hotel and Resort Hotel to acquire insights into the diverse factors that influence the booking process.

# Conclusion
The analysis indicates that City Hotel is more popular and generates higher revenue and profit compared to Resort Hotel. The peak booking months are July and August, with most bookings coming from Portugal and Great Britain. Guests typically stay for 1-4 days, and City Hotel has a higher retention rate than Resort Hotel. A robust cancellation policy is needed as the cancellation rate is 27%. Both direct and TA/TO channels contribute almost equally to the Average Daily Rate (ADR) in both hotels. Offering better deals to customers for longer stays can be a strategy to increase revenue, and there is a 39% correlation between total guests and ADR. Market segments have a fair amount of special requests from customers, and Agent ID no: 9 made the most bookings. TA/TO is the highest percentage of hotel bookings, recommending continued booking through TA/TO. 2016 had the highest bookings, while 2015 had less than 7500 bookings. Overall, City Hotel had the majority of bookings. These findings can be used by hoteliers to make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue, and optimize operations.
